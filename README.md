## Target STM32 Models

(the following README steps target this chip)
```
STM32F
411CEU6
```

(I have some of these laying around, not tested yet)
```
STM32F
103C8T6
```

## Steps

```
rustup target add thumbv7em-none-eabihf
```

## Board Connection

Using a CP2102 (3.3v logic) or another USB-Serial converter, connect its `TX` to pin `A10` and its `RX` to pin `A9`.
Also connect 3.3v from the CP2102 to the 3.3v pin on the STM32, and do the same for ground.
If you try to power the STM32 from its USB C port without this power connection, it won't work.

## Convert to BIN File

`cargo build` will create an ARM ELF file, but we need it in a binary `.bin` format.

### Install the Tools

```
cargo install cargo-binutils
rustup component add llvm-tools-preview
```

### Create the BIN File

```
cargo objcopy --release -- -O binary stm32-test.bin
```

## Flash the BIN File

```
stm32flash -b 230400 -w stm32-test.bin -v /dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART
```
